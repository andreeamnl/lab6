# Laboratory work nr.5 
<div>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"<i>Simulation</i> means that the program must run continuously, i.e. we start it and observe the process until we explicitly finish it.<br>
No input required to start, no input required to interact with the program.<br>
Simulation is an isolated process that represents the work of a system. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The user only affects it by changing configurations in runtime or before." <div>

<div>I've decided to make the purpose of my simulation a real-time statistics provider for my Taxi Company Union.<br>
Here I provide the following info:
<ol><li>
Number of taxis requested
<li>Number of taxis that actually provided service
<li>Number of taxi's called during night time
<li>Number of taxi's called during day time
<li>Number of police calls
<li>Number of police assigned fines
<li>Total money collected
<li>Number of "mischevious" costumers
<li>Total distance driven
<li>Fuel consumed
<li>Total Fuel costs
<li>Good feedback numbers
<li>Bad feedback numbers
</ol>
<br>
Each statistics term is updated once every 15 scenarios.
